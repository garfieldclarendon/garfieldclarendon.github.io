A project that uses E\+S\+P8266 Wi\+Fi modules that communicate with a Raspberry Pi server to control accessories on the Garfield-\/\+Clarendon Model Railroad Club.

\subsubsection*{Prerequisites}

The code running on the E\+S\+P8266 is developed using the Arduino I\+DE

The L\+C\+S\+Server application running on the Raspberry Pi makes use of the Qt framework. The E\+S\+P8266 uses http calls to communicate with the L\+C\+S\+Server application and U\+DP unicast messages to communicate with other E\+S\+P8266 controllers on the layout. A separate R\+E\+S\+Tful A\+PI provides access to commands to activate routes, set turnouts and update data in the configuration database.
